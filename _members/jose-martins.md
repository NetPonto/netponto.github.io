José Martins is a software developer who finds it very weird having to talk about himself in the third person. Other than that, he enjoys doing things a person who likes coding does: drinking coffee; brewing your own coffee and then drinking it; eating tasty meals; sipping through craft beer; delightfully ravishing a glass of wine; cooking; eating what you've just cooked; hiking; running; having a great meal because you've deserved it; sleeping and playing games. Oh, and coding, that as well, of course, what type of developer would he be?He is currently employed somewhere doing what needs to be done, like drinking coffee and petting animals.
