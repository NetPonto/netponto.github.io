I’m a long time IT Systems Engineer who has worked across many practices and disciplines in my career, with a primary focus on Microsoft-based Infrastructure solutions or Mixed-environments. At this point, I’ve got 20+ years of experience managing Microsoft-based corporate infrastructure, ranging from 50 user shops all the way up to 1,000+ user organizations.Currently, I’m a Systems Engineer at DevScope where my work ranges the full Microsoft stack, from On-Prem Services up to Azure, and solid exposure and knowledge around almost all of the core underlying technologies that support and power the core Microsoft Infrastructure stack. At present, I’m researching on Microservices, Container and Docker with a focus on Azure deployments.
