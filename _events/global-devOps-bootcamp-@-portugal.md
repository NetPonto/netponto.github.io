Global DevOps Bootcamp is a global event that will be held on Saturday June 17th and is all about DevOps on the Microsoft Stack. Centrally organized <a href="https://xpirit.com" title="Xpirit" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Xpirit </a> and <a href="http://www.solidify.se/" title="Solidfy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Solidify</a> and offered to you by Tiago Pascoal. During this 1-day event we will join (Microsoft) DevOps communities all around the world to talk, learn and play with DevOps concepts.

Goals of the GlobalDevOpsBootcamp:
* DevOps in general
* Insights into where we are heading when it comes to DevOps and new technologies
* Get people's hands dirty and let them play with all the good Microsoft DevOps stuff

This year’s theme will be "From server to serverless in a DevOps world".
We will kick off with an introduction of no one less than <a href="http://www.donovanbrown.com/" title="Donovan Brown" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Donovan Brown</a>, followed by a keynote from the local partner about where we are heading with DevOps.

After that it’s time to get your hands dirty! Competing in groups you will transform an existing “traditional” application into a fully-fledged, containerized or Serverless application. Naturally you need to take care of all the DevOps practices like monitoring, pipelines and collaboration.

Of course you won’t be on your own. During the day you will be supported and guided by local experts who are active in the Microsoft Community.
