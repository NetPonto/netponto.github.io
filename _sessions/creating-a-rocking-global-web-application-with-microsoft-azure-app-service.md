In today's world, "Global" is the reality. When we create a new web application we need to always think about it as an application that will have global reach. This is a good challenge for Application Architects. Creating global applications is no easy catch, we have a lot of concerns, not only technical but also legal.
In this session, we will check how Azure App Service can helps us reach this global application goal and how other related services, like Traffic Manager, Service Bus, Azure Storage and SQL Databases can help in order to create a global application.
