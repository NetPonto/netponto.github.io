We live surrounded by bad practices, stress, and fear of missing a delivery timeline. We all work or worked, on projects with those characteristics. If we don't enforce a shared culture of testing, no matter what, the quality of the software that we produce will suffer. With this talk/topic, I want to share the problems and solutions that will enable us to create a shared testing culture across our team and company.
