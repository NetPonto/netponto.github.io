We’re going to discuss gRPC, Google’s open-source RPC framework. I’ll dive a bit into the history of RPC as a protocol, and what its historical use has been. I’ll also highlight some benefits to adopt gRPC and how its possible to swap out parts of gRPC and still take advantage of gRPC’s benefits. Finally I’ll answer the question that has been on many lips since gRPC was announced —
 what does this mean for REST?
