Monoliths are crap, all hail micro-nano-mini-something!Who wouldn't want to work in a distributed system with lots of tinny little parts running on something called cloud that exists somewhere with better weather than where you live? Whenever I hear monolith I think of our long distant relatives, before discovering fire, staring at the ceiling of their cave wondering what dependency to add next to their gigantic system. Those where the old days of software, now we have fire and the wheel, so anything's possible!I'll share with you my experience of going from a monolith to microservices running on a cloud, the good's and the bad's and maybe something else, depending on the coffee.
