In the world of agile software development, the database development process introduces some challenges to the application development process. The delivery of changes at database level tend to be a different and/or separated process from the application delivery process (or even an entirely manual process). This gap between database and application development contributes to turn the database in the bottleneck in the agile process.In this session, I will show how to setup a deployment pipeline (using VSTS, Octopus Deploy, etc.) able to manage database (Azure SQL Database) and application (Azure Web Apps) changes. Through the deployment pipeline, I will explore the aspects, concepts (source control, continuous integration, continuous delivery) and strategies that allow bringing together databases and applications in the deployment process reducing the delivery pain.The main purpose is to understand that applications and databases (in Azure or outside) do not need to live in different worlds with different deployment processes.
