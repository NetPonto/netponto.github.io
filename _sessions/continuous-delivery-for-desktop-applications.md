Continuous Delivery is a key enabler of fast release cycles, fast feedback and high performance. Most of what we know on how to do CD is mainly oriented towards server software, where we control the environment. For desktop applications, distributed to uncontrolled environments things can get a little tricky, and the application size can be a problem.Enabling CD for our desktop applications has changed the way we develop software in many aspects. In this presentation, weâ€™ll talk about how we implemented CD to distribute our applications in an incremental manner and talk about many of the discoveries we made along the way.
