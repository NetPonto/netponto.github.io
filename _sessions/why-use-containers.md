The last 4 years we’ve seen several advances on containerization technologies, with new tools and features released at an increasing rate each year. Also with the DevOps (http://bit.ly/WhatIs-DevOps) culture being adopted by more and more companies worldwide, the boundaries of Developer and Operations teams are more and more thin. From Microsoft’s BUILD 2018 (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build/content), we’ve seen several new features being released soon and some launched at the event.As a Systems Engineer that used to be a Developer, I find myself using Visual Studio more and more at my daily work. On this session, we will try to cover the basics of container usage, i.e., container architecture implementations by Docker and Microsoft, both on Prem and on the Cloud. From some simple examples of .NET Core applications, using your favorite development interface and deploying somewhere; through some more elaborate scenarios to the Cloud journey.
