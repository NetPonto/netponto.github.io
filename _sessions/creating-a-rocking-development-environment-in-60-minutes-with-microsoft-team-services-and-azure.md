This is a demo-dependent session!!!
From zero to a full professional environment in order to deliver the best in class Applications Lifecycle Management. This will be done using cloud based tools and in just 60 minutes. We will create a full Microsoft ALM environment using the Microsoft Team Services (former VSO: Visual Studio Online) and Microsoft Azure. All the tools can be used free of charge for personal and light business.
