Working on applications with an old code base that require new functionalities and improvementsalong the years can be hard and frustrating for all - developers, product owners and otherstakeholders.As the application grows, with new modules which are being built on top of old modules that havealso been built on top of other modules by different teams, developers using different technologies,so does its complexity and maintenance costs. This seriously affects developer’s motivation,productivity and confidence in fixing bugs or even refactoring old modules.In this talk I’ll be showing some examples, and hopefully give you some ideas, on how we have beenevolving our application and renewing old modules, how to build some “failsafe” mechanisms so thatyou can detect when you accidently broke something that you weren’t expecting.
